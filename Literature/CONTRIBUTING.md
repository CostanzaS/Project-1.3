# How to contribute

#### File submission
Upload code you know works.
Be sure to label the file you submit as well as having comments within the file.

#### When to fork
I can't think of a relevant way forking can be used when you can just make a new branch.
This is because forking allows for one to use another's code as a jumping off point or for one to freely change another's code without affecting the source.
Since this is a group project

#### When to make a branch
You should make a new branch when you're adding a new feature that involves pre-existing files.
For example, adding a clear line method in a repo that has the rest of the tetris code would call for this.
You can compare the differences between the same files in two different branches to account for other people changing code, this is not an issue.
If you feel uncomfortable with merging branches, make an issue asking someone else to do it.
